  Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the
  world <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard
  skills" like coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft
   skills" like guessing keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and
  knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.

<p>
  We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
  benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join
