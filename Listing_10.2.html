    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach the world
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, which includes both "hard skills" like
      coding, command lines, and version control, and "soft skills" like guessing
      keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just
      reboot the darn thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can
      benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

  <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
    Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
    sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a
    billion people, and probably more.

          Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
          Michael is the creator of the
          <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
          Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
          <a href="https://learnenough.com/"> Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
          introductory sequence.

          Michael is also notorious as the founder of
          <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
          <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
          Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are
          slightly exaggerated.

          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
          on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
          interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
          interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

          You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on
          Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true
          nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code
          from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
